The Underwater Video Annotation Tool (UVAT) is an open source tool that greatly improves the time needed to annotate video data. This repository contains the code for the tool to work in Linux and Windows systems.

    - Python 3.10+*
    - PyTorch and corresponding Cuda

** Install with conda **

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosepSanchezCano/UVAT
cd UVAT
conda create --name UVAT --file requirements.txt
```

To be able to run the application is needed to download the weights from : link

It is enough to drop the folder inside the repository

## Things to be aware of

- The pySimpleGUI version should 4.60.0, the newer ones present issues with updating the frames shown in the screen.
- The RAM used in this version of the program is not optimized as there is not a buffer system to load the videos. You may need huge amounts of RAM for long videos.
- We recommend to use 60Hz display as the GUI library does not support high refresh monitors.
- Using shorter videos (2 min) is preferable to avoid issues with python not handling well the amounts of RAM required for some of the tasks of the annotator
- A web version is on the works, so until the web version is finished this version won't have bigger updates
